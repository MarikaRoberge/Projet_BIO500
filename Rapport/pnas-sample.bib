	abstract = {Protected areas are central in strategies to conserve biodiversity. Effective area-based conservation relies on biodiversity data, but the current biodiversity knowledge base is insufficient and limited by geographic and taxonomic biases. Public participation in biodiversity monitoring such as via community-based monitoring or citizen science increases data collection but also contributes to replicating these biases or introducing new ones. Here we examine how participatory monitoring has changed the landscape of open biodiversity knowledge in protected areas using biodiversity data shared on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We highlight a growing dominance of participatory monitoring within protected areas. We find that patterns in geographic, taxonomic, and threatened species coverage differ from non-participatory monitoring, suggesting complementarity between the two approaches. The relative contribution of participatory monitoring varies with characteristics of both protected areas and monitoring programs. We synthesize these results to derive context-specific strategies for extending the conservation impact of participatory biodiversity monitoring.},

	title = {Modélisation spatio-temporelle de la dynamique d'émergence de lépidoptères univoltins à partir de données opportunistes},
	abstract = {Managers of natural areas wish to use their opportunistic databases to assess the dynamics of biodiversity in the areas they manage. However, the analysis of opportunistic data requires special attention since the sampling effort is unknown and spatially heterogeneous. Moreover, species distribution models based on the niche rarely take into account the temporal dimension and do not explain the processes involved in the ecological dynamics studied. Based on opportunistic butterﬂy occurrence data from the Écrins National Park, we developed a spatio-temporal model describing the emergence dynamics of the adult stage along environmental gradients. The model allows us to separate spatial variations in sampling effort from the spatial distribution of the species considered and to estimate key parameters of the emergence dynamics. The estimates of ﬁrst emergence dates are relatively early in the year, but their trends are consistent. Environmental variables (altitude and forest) have a negative effect on the relative abundance of species. The integration of climatic data would allow a better understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of emergence dates and the study of the capacity of species to adapt to climate change by modifying their phenology and range.},

	doi = {10.1086/381004},
	abstract = {The decline of biodiversity with latitude has received great attention, but both the concise pattern and the causes of the gradient are under strong debate. Most studies of the latitudinal gradient comprise only one or few organism types and are often restricted to certain region or habitat types. To test for significant variation in the gradient between organisms, habitats, or regions, a meta-analysis was conducted on nearly 600 latitudinal gradients assembled from the literature. Each gradient was characterized by two effect sizes, strength (correlation coefficient) and slope, and additionally by 14 variables describing organisms, habitats, and regions. The analysis corroborated the high generality of the latitudinal diversity decline. Gradients on regional scales were significantly stronger and steeper than on local scales, and slopes also varied with sampling grain. Both strength and slope increased with organism body mass, and strength increased with trophic level. The body mass-effect size relation varied for ecto- versus homeotherm organisms and for different dispersal types, suggesting allometric effects on energy use and dispersal ability as possible mechanisms for the body mass effect. Latitudinal gradients were weaker and less steep in freshwater than in marine or terrestrial environments and differed significantly between continents and habitat types. The gradient parameters were not affected by hemisphere or the latitudinal range covered. This analysis is the first to describe these general and significant patterns, which have important consequences for models aiming to explain the latitudinal gradient.},
